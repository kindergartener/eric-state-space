fractal.\nVery informally, it's the set of complex numbers \\(c\\) for which the function \\(f(z) = z^2 + c\\) doesn't diverge when iterated to infinity.\nRenders of the set show an infinitely complex boundary that appears recursive and extremely detailed. You may also be familiar with\n\"zooms\" of the Mandelbrot set that showcase this recursive nature:\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Render of the Mandelbrot set and a zoom from the Wikipedia page.\n  \n\nIn this post I attempt to render the Buddhabrot, a related fractal spawned from the points that do diverge.\nWhere's the Buddha?\nIn short, the Buddhabrot is a probability distribution over the paths of points that diverge in the Mandelbrot fractal.\nIn other words, we look at each point that escapes in the Mandelbrot fractal and track each point it passes through on its journey\nto divergence. This essentially creates a heatmap of the most commonly-visited spots as points travel off to infinity. Here's what it looks like:\n\n  \n\n\n\nWow! The image is still fractal in nature but with a ghostly, almost outer-space-like element to it. In this way we can really see the fractal's namesake -- the Buddha\nsitting in meditation pose.\nOkay I'm actually lying to you. The picture above isn't the real Buddhabrot. The real image is just black-and-white and can look completely different based on the parameters you chose.\nI'll show you the rendering process involved in creating the final image.\nThe Rendering Process\nThe logic behind rendering a Buddhabrot image is pretty simple. First we create 2D image buffer with dimensions\nWIDTH \\(\\times\\) HEIGHT. Each pixel \\((i, j)\\) for \\(i = 1, \\ldots , m\\) and \\(j = 1, \\ldots , n\\) corresponds to the complex number\n\\(c = \\frac{\\mathrm{WIDTH}}{m} + \\frac{\\mathrm{HEIGHT}}{n} i\\).\nEach pixel has an associated counter that starts at 0. We sample SAMPLES random points (in our case 16,000,000) and iterate them\nthrough the Mandelbrot function \\(f(z) = z^2 + c\\). For points that escape within a certain number of MAX_ITERATIONS, increment the counters\nof all pixels passed through during that process. Discard points that don't escape with this process.\nIn the end we have a histogram showing the likelihood that escaped points pass these given pixels. The final step is to color each pixel in the output image a certain\ngrayscale value based on the normalized range of all pixel counter values.\nWhat we end up with is an image like so:\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Buddhabrot renders with (from top-left to bottom-right) MAX_ITERATIONS=16, 64, 256, 4096.\n  \n\nGreat! But these images are still in black-and-white. In the following section, I borrow a technique from astronomy\nto breathe life into these pictures.\nPseudocolor\nPseudocolor techniques map intensity values to colors in grayscale images. If you're wondering why the first Buddhabrot image looks like some sort of nebula,\nit's because the same technique is used in astronomy to map non-visible light wavelengths to visible ones (colors).\nIn our case, we can change the value of MAX_ITERATIONS and map each output image to a specific color. Then, we layer the images on top of each other with the correct blending mode to\nproduce the final colorized image:\n\n  \n  \n    Map MAX_ITERATIONS=64 to blue, 256 to red, and 4096 to green. Then combine with lighten blending mode.\n  \n\nBelow are a few examples of zoomed-in pseudocolor Buddhabrots:\n\n\n  \n  \n    Pseudocolor Buddhabrot zoom centered at -0.3 + 0.65i\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Pseudocolor Buddhabrot zoom centered at -1.25 + 0.0i\n  \n\nTowards Nirvana\nThe goal of this experiment was to create some neat visualizations using Rust and learn a thing or two along the way. While I was able to significantly decrease\nrendering times by parallelizing with rayon, the computation remains solely on the CPU. Perhaps one day I'll revisit the Buddha on the GPU,\nsimilar to this project. Furthermore, I'd love to approach the rendering process through a probabilistic lens by leveraging the\nMetropolis-Hastings Algorithm.\n","id":"http://ericstate.space/blog/buddhabrot/","title":"Buddhabrot"},"http://ericstate.space/blog/fibonacci/":{"body":"Perhaps one of the most well-known numeric sequences, the Fibonacci sequence sees each number as the sum of the two\npreceding numbers. Starting with \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), we can find the next element by doing \\(0 + 1 = 1\\), then \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) and\nso on. The first 10 Fibonacci numbers are \\(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34\\). The Fibonacci sequence\ncan be defined by the recurrence relation:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{F_1} &amp;= 0 , \\mathrm{F_2} = 1 \\newline\n\\mathrm{F_n} &amp;= \\mathrm{F_{n-1}} + \\mathrm{F_{n-2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nOn an unrelated note, I started learning the Rust programming language last year. While reading about the Fibonacci numbers, I started thinking to myself,\n\"Hey, I should write a Rust program to generate these!\" But that begs the question, how fast can I calculate these Fibonacci numbers?\nCan Rust provide me any unique benefits towards this goal? In this exploration, I try to calculate the largest Fibonacci number possible in under\n1 second, in Rust.\nThe Naïve Approach\nThe obvious way to calculate Fibonacci numbers in Rust would be to directly translate the recurrence relation above--in\nother words, the recursive approach. The code for this is pretty simple actually:\n\nSimple, but not really practical. This algorithm has exponential time complexity, let's call it \\(O(2^n)\\).\nThe runtime graph below is pretty pitiful, as we can only calculate the 38th Fibonacci number this way. I could do that with\na pen, paper, and a free afternoon!\n\n  \n  \n    Runtime graph for recursive Fibonacci with max_n = 38.\n  \n\nSliding Window\nThis next algorithm is a substantial improvement over the last and one of the most commonly\nused Fibonacci algorithms.\n\nThis algorithm runs in linear time, \\(O(n)\\). We quickly run into an issue though; the maximum\nvalue a u128 integer type can hold is \\(2^{128} - 1 \\approx 3.40 \\times 10^{38}\\). The largest\nFibonacci number within this bound is \\(\\mathrm{F_{186}} \\approx 3.33 \\times 10^{38}\\), so we won't be\nable to calculate any terms after 186. We must use a type that can handle arbitrarily large integers.\nBig Integers\nI use the num_bigint crate\nwhich gives us the type BigUint, a vector of digits. The capacity of this type is still limited\nby the underlying allocator and operating system, but it should be enough to store any\nFibonacci number we need.\nImplementing this with the example above we get:\n\nLet's see what the runtime graph looks like:\n\n  \n  \n    Runtime graph for sliding window Fibonacci with max_n = 694,720.\n  \n\nMatrix Multiplication\nThis next algorithm makes use of a lesser-known matrix identity for the Fibonacci numbers.\nStart with the observation that:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 1 \\newline\n1 &amp; 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\newline\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\newline\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 1 \\newline\n1 &amp; 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\newline\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 \\newline\n2\n\\end{bmatrix} \\newline\n\\dots\n$$\nIn general, the square matrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\) sends \\(\\begin{bmatrix} \\mathrm{F_{n}} \\ \\mathrm{F_{n-1}} \\end{bmatrix}\\)\nto the \"next\" vector \\(\\begin{bmatrix} \\mathrm{F_{n+1}} \\ \\mathrm{F_{n}} \\end{bmatrix}\\):\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 1 \\newline\n1 &amp; 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathrm{F_{n}} \\newline\n\\mathrm{F_{n-1}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathrm{F_{n}} + \\mathrm{F_{n-1}} \\newline\n\\mathrm{F_{n}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathrm{F_{n+1}} \\newline\n\\mathrm{F_{n}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nUsing similar logic and the magic of induction, one can show that the square matrix \"generates\" Fibonacci numbers:\n$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 1 \\newline\n1 &amp; 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n^{n}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathrm{F_{n+1}} &amp; \\mathrm{F_{n}} \\newline\n\\mathrm{F_{n}} &amp; \\mathrm{F_{n-1}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n}\n$$\nThis is the formula I used for my Fibonacci algorithm! If we can multiply \\(n\\) matrices, we can\nget the \\(n+1\\) Fibonacci number. In theory this has \\(O(n)\\) runtime complexity\nsince we perform an \\(O(1)\\) matrix multiplication $n$ times, but we can do better.\nBinary Exponentiation\nBinary exponentiation or exponentiating by squaring\nis a method to calculate integer powers of a number in \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) multiplications\ninstead of \\(n\\). We start by writing the exponent in binary as such:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3^{11} &amp; = 3^{1011_2} \\newline\n&amp; = 3^8 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\newline\n&amp; = 6561 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 3 \\newline\n&amp; = 177147\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe key realization here is that we can get \\(3^2\\) by squaring \\(3^1\\) and\n\\(3^8\\) by squaring \\(3^2\\) twice. In this way, we can \"build up\" to our answer\nby squaring each term for the next power of two:\n$$\nx^n =\n\\begin{cases}\n(x^\\frac{n}{2})^2 &amp; \\text{if } x \\text{ is even} \\newline\nx \\cdot (x^\\frac{n-1}{2})^2 &amp; \\text{if } x \\text{ is odd}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe can recurse on \\(x^\\frac{n}{2}\\) or \\(x^\\frac{n-1}{2}\\) until we get to \\(n=1\\), at which point we stop.\nSo the complexity is \\(O(\\log n)\\): we compute \\(\\log n\\) powers of \\(x\\) and do at most \\(\\log n\\) multiplications.\nI use an iterative version of this algorithm with the above Fibonacci matrix identity to compute\nFibonacci numbers in \\(O(\\log n)\\) time. Here's how it's done:\n\nHere matrix_mult is a function that multiplies 2x2 matrices. Looking at the graph,\nwe achieve a significant improvement over the sliding window method, with a maximum\niteration of \\(n=4,370,432\\):\n\n  \n  \n    Runtime graph for matrix multiplication Fibonacci with max_n = 4,370,432.\n  \n\nWait, why does this look more like a staircase than a slide? Something's going on here.\nHeap\nThere's something nonlinear happening here. We see these discrete runtime spikes occurring at around \\(n\\approx1\\mathrm{e}6\\),\n\\(2\\mathrm{e}6\\), and \\(4\\mathrm{e}6\\). These threshold-based jumps suggest something about the way BigUint handles large numbers.\nInternally, the type is a dynamically sized Vec&lt;usize&gt;; when the number of bits (digits) exceeds a power of 2, the buffer\nmust reallocate its maximum capacity. This reallocation involves expensive operations like heap allocation and copying old digits.\nIn essence, the cost per step depends on the current size of BigUint: once\n\\(\\mathrm{F_n}\\) reaches a new order of magnitude, each multiplication gets more expensive.\nIt's worth mentioning the .clone() method used to return our Fibonacci number. BigUint does not implement the Copy trait, so\nwe can't just move the value out the matrix. For large \\(n\\), cloning could bottleneck performance, although I couldn't find a way to avoid it.\nFast Doubling\nThe fast doubling approach makes use of the \"double-angle\" identities for the Fibonacci numbers. We can arrive at\nthese identities by simply squaring the matrix representation:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathrm{F_{2n+1}} &amp; \\mathrm{F_{2n}} \\newline\n\\mathrm{F_{2n}} &amp; \\mathrm{F_{2n-1}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n&amp; =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 1 \\newline\n1 &amp; 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n^{2n} \\newline \\newline\n&amp; =\n\\left(\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; 1 \\newline\n1 &amp; 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n^{n}\n\\right)\n^{2} \\newline \\newline\n&amp; =\n\\left(\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathrm{F_{n+1}} &amp; \\mathrm{F_{n}} \\newline\n\\mathrm{F_{n}} &amp; \\mathrm{F_{n-1}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\right)\n^{2} \\newline \\newline\n&amp; =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathrm{F_{n+1}^{2} + F_{n}^{2}} &amp; \\mathrm{F_{n}(F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})} \\newline\n\\mathrm{F_{n}(F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})} &amp; \\mathrm{F_{n}^{2} + F_{n-1}^{2}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nNote that \\(\\mathrm{F_{n}(F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})}\\) can be written as \\(\\mathrm{F_{n}(2F_{n+1} - F_{n})}\\) using\n\\(\\mathrm{F_{n-1} = F_{n+1} - F_{n}}\\). Finally, we equate the terms in corresponding matrix entries to get\nthe doubling identities:\n$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{F_{2n+1}} &amp; = \\mathrm{F_{n+1}^{2} + F_{n}^{2}} \\newline\n\\mathrm{F_{2n}} &amp; = \\mathrm{F_{n}(2F_{n+1} - F_{n})}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n$$\nWe can use these identities to compute \\((\\mathrm{F_{n}}, \\mathrm{F_{n+1}})\\) by recursing on \\(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor\\), which gives\na \\(O(\\log n)\\) recursion depth.\nGiven \\((a, b) = (\\mathrm{F_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}}, \\mathrm{F_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor +1}})\\), let\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nc &amp;= a(2b - a) \\newline\nd &amp;= a^2 + b^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nOur desired Fibonacci numbers are\n$$\n(\\mathrm{F_{n}}, \\mathrm{F_{n+1}}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n(c, d) &amp; \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\newline\n(d, c + d) &amp; \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nand we can implement this as follows:\n\nThis algorithm is a significant improvement over Matrix Multiplication, achieving a maximum iteration of\n\\(n = 17,937,917\\):\n\n  \n  \n    Runtime graph for fast doubling Fibonacci with max_n = 17,937,917.\n  \n\nThe main thing to note is that this process involves just 3 BigUint multiplications: one for calculating \\(c\\) and two for\n\\(d\\). Compare this to the 8-12 BigUint multiplications required for the Matrix Multiplication method and we can see why Fast Doubling\nis able to calculate such large numbers, despite both algorithms being \\(O(\\log n)\\).\nDiscussion\nI tested 4 different methods of calculating Fibonacci numbers in hopes of finding the highest \\(\\mathrm{F_n}\\) in under 1 second.\nResults largely depended on the algorithm used: the recursive implementation barely calculated the 40th Fibonacci number\nwhile the fast doubling method approached almost 18,000,000!\nThe figures below show a more direct comparison between algorithms:\n\n\n  \n    Algorithm\n    Highest n\n    Time Complexity\n    Space Complexity\n  \n  \n    Recursive\n    38\n    O(2n)\n    O(n)\n  \n  \n    Sliding Win\n    694,720\n    O(n)\n    O(n)\n  \n  \n    Matrix Mult\n    4,370,432\n    O(log n)\n    O(n)\n  \n  \n    Fast Doubl\n    17,937,917\n    O(log n)\n    O(log n)\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n    Comparison of runtimes for sliding window, matrix multiplication, and fast doubling Fibonacci.\n  \n\nI was surprised to find that despite both being \\(O(\\log n)\\) runtime algorithms, matrix multiplication\nand fast doubling achieved such drastic iteration differences. I suspect the reason is that fast doubling not only performs fewer BigUint\noperations but also takes up less memory. It can therefore benefit more from cache locality and avoid overhead associated with\nrepeated memory allocations.\nThis analysis was very preliminary and I'd love to dive deeper into this topic in the future. For example, the BigUint multiplication operations\ncould be implemented using fast integer multiplication such as Karatsuba or Schönhage–Strassen.\nI could also experiment with other Fibonacci/Lucas number identities besides the typical \"double-angle\" identity.\n","id":"http://ericstate.space/blog/fibonacci/","title":"Fibonacci Numbers in Rust"}},"docInfo":{"http://ericstate.space/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://ericstate.space/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://ericstate.space/blog/buddhabrot/":{"body":391,"title":1},"http://ericstate.space/blog/fibonacci/":{"body":1037,"title":3}},"length":4},"lang":"English"}
